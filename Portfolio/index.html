             <h1>My Love for Reading Books</h1>
             <h2>100 Books in 12 Months</h2>
             <p>While I was growing up, I had little to no interest in reading.
                This was very strange as my mother is the type of person who continuously advocates for the activity of reading.
                My love for reading all began in March 2021, during the lockdown as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.
                At that time, I did not have a cellphone or laptop, so I could not pass the time using those devices.
                When my mother suggested that I start reading her collection of books, I was hesitant.
                However, this collection, which was just under 110 books, was not made up of your typical classics or what one might expect to find in a 21st-century home library.</p>
        
             <h3>Books are the Root of All Knowledge</h3>
             <p>One of the first books I began reading was <strong>Cleopatra's Shadows</strong> by <strong>Emily Holleman</strong>.
                It quickly became one of my favorite books of all time.
                The book is set in ancient Egypt, during the reign of the Macedonian general Ptolemy I Soter,
                who was a companion of Alexander the Great and ruled the Ptolemaic dynasty alongside his wife,
                who was also his sister. He is known today as the father of the famous Cleopatra,
                who was the daughter of one of his concubines.
                The most captivating element of this book is that it centers not on Cleopatra but rather on her half-sister.
                Arsinoe.
                This book opened my mind; I had only basic knowledge about Egypt, and this historical fiction helped expand my general knowledge.</p>

             <h4>The Benefits of Reading</h4>
             <p>Reading has numerous benefits.
                It strengthens the brain and can reduce stress. It will also expand your knowledge whilst enhancing creativity and imagination.
                One of my  favorite benefits, is that it improves memory, concentration and focus.
                Last but not least is the overall positive impact it will have on improving your vocabulary and communication skills.
